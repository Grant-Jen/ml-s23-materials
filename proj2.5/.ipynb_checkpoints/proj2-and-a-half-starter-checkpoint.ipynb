    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Project 2.5 picks up where Project 2 left off.  Recall that in Project 2, were exploring logistic regression by using an example from \n",
    "the TV show *The Good Place*.  The show is centered around a number of humans who have died and find themselves in the afterlife.  In this conception\n",
    "of the afterlife, humans are sent to \"the Good Place\" or \"the Bad Place\" after death.  All humans are assigned a numerical score based on the morality of their conduct in life, and only those with the very highest scores are sent to the \"Good Place\", where they enjoy eternal happiness; all others experience an eternity of torture in the \"Bad Place.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project 2.5, we expand the concepts of the good place and the bad place to also include the \"medium place,\" and we will attempt to classify which \n",
    "of these three places someone will end up in the TV-show-afterlife.  We will use **multinomial logistic regression** for this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "***You will probably want to refresh your memory by re-reading the logistic-regression-3 notebook, which covers multinomial linear regression.***\n",
    "\n",
    "***We also make one slight change in this project: we use 0-based class indexing, rather than 1-based.  So our 3 classes are 0/1/2, not 1/2/3. We\n",
    "do this so they match up with the array indices in Python.***\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we have data for 1000 people about how often they:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let someone merge in front of them in traffic\n",
    "- Didn't tip their server at a restaurant\n",
    "- Held a door open for someone who was walking behind them\n",
    "- Littered\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be our four features for the problem.  Our data set consists of these four features tallied for 1000 different people.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this project, you will write Python code in places marked\n",
    "`# YOUR CODE HERE`.  There are also code cells in this notebook you must run\n",
    "to produce various kinds of plots and graphs.  There are also a number of cells\n",
    "marked with `# YOUR ANSWER HERE` where you will answer questions.\n"

    "### Computing the gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, we will use gradient descent to find the best matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of weights.  Recall this matrix has $K$ rows (one per class) and $n+1$ columns\n",
    "(one per feature, plus the bias feature).  We do this by taking the partial derivative of the $J$ function with respect to each\n",
    "entry in $\\boldsymbol{W}$ individually, which looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our formula we want is \n",
    "$$\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial w_{k,j}} J(\\boldsymbol{W}) =  \n",
    "\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial w_{k,j}} \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^m L \\left(  \n",
    "    \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}^{(i)}, \\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)} \\right) =\n",
    "\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\left( \\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}_k^{(i)} - \\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)}_k \\right)x^{(i)}_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's really understand what this equation is saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part, $\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial w_{k,j}}$ is the symbol for taking a partial derivative, but the $w_{k,j}$ part is important just to go over\n",
    "what this notation means.  In particular, we use $w_{k,j}$ to mean the $k$'th row and $j$'th column of matrix $W$ (row is always first, column is always second\n",
    "in the subscripts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}_k^{(i)}$ is the $k$'th term of the $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}^{(i)}$ vector, which is the prediction vector for the $i$'th\n",
    "training example.  Don't forget, `run_model()` gives you this vector!  (We always use $i$ to loop over training examples.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that $\\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)}_k$ is the $k$'th term of the $\\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)}$ vector, which is the one-hot \"true\" vector for the $i$'th training\n",
    "example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that $x^{(i)}_j$ is the $j$'th feature (entry) in the $x^{(i)}$ vector, which is the feature vector for training example $i$.  (We always use $j$\n",
    "to loop over features.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So putting all of those together, just remember that $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}_k^{(i)}$, $\\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)}_k$, and $x^{(i)}_j$ are **numbers**, not \n",
    "**vectors**.  So each of those terms you're adding up are just taking three numbers and doing one subtraction and one multiplication.\n",

    "\n",
    "So how do you compute this mess?  The first thing to realize is that this gradient you are computing is another matrix of the same size as \n",
    "the $W$ matrix.  Each entry in the matrix is computed from that formula above.  So the easiest way to do this is with three nested loops, one each\n",
    "for $i$ (training example), $j$ (feature), and $k$ (class), though you may not want to nest them in that order.  In fact, depending on how you like to\n",
    "think about this, you may not even need three loops: you can get away with two if you reframe the $\\left( \\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}_k^{(i)} - \\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)}_k \\right)x^{(i)}_j$ computation as a vector-times-scalar computation: $\\left( \\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}^{(i)} - \\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)} \\right)x^{(i)}_j$.  In other words,\n",
    "you can drop the $k$ loop and think of computing the **vector** $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{y}}^{(i)} - \\boldsymbol{y}^{(i)}$ and then multiplying that vector\n",
    "by $x^{(i)}_j$, which is a scalar.  This gives you an entire column of the gradient matrix you are creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can do whatever's easier---if 3 loops makes more sense, do that.  If you understand the 2 loop version, use that."
