    "of the afterlife, humans are sent to \"the Good Place\" or \"the Bad Place\" after death.  All humans are assigned a numerical score based on the morality of their conduct in life, and only those with the very highest scores are sent to the \"Good Place\", where they enjoy eternal happiness; all others experience an eternity of torture in the \"Bad Place.\"\n",

    "In this project, you will explore using logistic regression to predict whether someone will end up in the \"Good Place or the \"Bad Place\" based on an\n",
    "extremely scaled down version of their conduct in life.  In particular, we have data for 1000 people about how often they:\n",
